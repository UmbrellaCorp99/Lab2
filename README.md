# Lab2

This lab generates a white display with a black circle in the center. The user can press the arrow keys as well as U, D, L, and R keys to move the circle around the screen. The circle will only move briefly after pressing the key, long presses will not move the circle further. You must have Allegro installed to run the program, and both "Primitives Addon" and "Dialogue Addon" must be activated in the Allegro 5 properties menu.
